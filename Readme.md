# MathPlotter

A simple plotter for mathematical functions

## Getting started

Clone the repo, then serve it on a simple web server (like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve))

## Demo

You can see the working sample [here](https://tidy-code.github.io/MathPlotter.html)

## Notes

-   The derivation (differential) option is just a simple implementation and may not be accurate
-   To add new functions see the initial sample functions notation and write your own according.

**It's very basic and I appreciate any fix or suggestions**
